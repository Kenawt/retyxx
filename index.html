        <p id="message">From the little things—like the way you say certain words, to the way you understand me without me needing to say much—I’ve come to realize how special you are. You’re someone who makes life brighter just by being in it, and I genuinely cherish every moment we spend together. I don’t just want to be someone in your life; I want to be your person—the one who makes you feel as appreciated, cared for, and loved as you deserve. I want to show you, every day, that you matter to me, that your happiness is something I care about deeply, and that I’m willing to grow, learn, and communicate with you to make things work.❤️</p>
        <p id="finalMessage">So what I'm really saying is ... will you be my girlfriend? 💖</p>
